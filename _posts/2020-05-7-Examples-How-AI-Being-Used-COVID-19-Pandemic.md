#### AI Related COVID-19 Uses

The following is a collection of resources that demonstrate how AI is being used during the COVID-19 pandemic.

##### Google Protecting Against Cyberthreats

A dramatic rise in different types of attacks has been reported during this crisis. Chief among these threats is phishing (an attempt to obtain sensitive and/or personal information from one entity by email, text, phone, or other similar means by another entity posing as a legitimate source). These attacks have targeted both the innocent public as well as health organizations.

Google reported that Gmail blocks more than 100 million phishing emails per day. During the week of 4/5 – 4/11, over 18 million malware and phishing emails related to COVID-19 were blocked, along with over 240 million COVID-19 related daily spam messages. Google is handling these astounding rates using machine learning tools that augment and further inspect analysis by traditional malware scanning software. For example, machine learning found malware deeply embedded in emails that were trying to impersonate the World Health Organization (who.int). Google worked with WHO to ensure that DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) was better implemented. Other attacks are been found embedded in URLs, various types of documents (e.g., Word and Excel), as well as the typical .png and .jpg files. The set of AI tools also aid in implementing sandboxes to protect against zero-day threats.
