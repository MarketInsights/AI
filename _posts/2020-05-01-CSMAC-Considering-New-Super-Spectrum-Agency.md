The Commerce Spectrum Management Advisory Committee (CSMAC), an advisory group under the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), has for the past few months been looking at some radical changes for future spectrum regulation, including [creating](https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/spectrum_strategy_governance_briefing_012820.pdf) a new spectrum agency to address existing and future spectrum strategies, allocations, and management.

In their most recent [update](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/csmac_sc1_presentation_april_22_2020.pdf) to the full CSMAC, Working Group 1 (WG1), who is looking at the various options, advanced discussion on three possible options: (1) standing up an new independent super agency combining all (i.e., an “Unity Agency”) or parts (i.e., a “Spectrum Resource Agency”) of existing FCC and NTIA functions into one entity; (2) shifting more control of spectrum decisions to either just the FCC or the NTIA - at present, each serve a role in spectrum polices; or (3) a hybrid of the above options with an enhanced inter-government MOU between the FCC and NTIA.

WG1 will be meeting again in the next few weeks to finalize their proposal to the full CSMAC for vote.
