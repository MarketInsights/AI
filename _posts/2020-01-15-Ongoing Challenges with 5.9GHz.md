What ultimately happens in the current FCC 5.9 GHz proceeding remains to be seen with varying opinions readily available on the asking.  But in response to the FCC released, but yet published (to-date), [“Use of the 5.850-5.925 GHz Band,”](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-19-129A1.pdf) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), the Department of Transportation (DOT), has provided insights in to its preliminary technical [assessment](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/research-and-technology/360181/oobe-energy-59-safety-band-final-120619.pdf) of the proceeding and has outlined its [concerns](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/research-and-technology/359811/preliminary-technical-assessment-fcc-59-ghz-nprm-05dec2019-final.pdf) with the Commission’s proposal.   

As stated in DOT’s assessment, their primary concern, as expected, is with the reallocation of 45-megahertz from its assigned 75-megahertz for ITS and, as such, its impact on delivering safety of life services.  According to DOT, the proposed FCC actions would delay deployments of life-saving services, not accelerate which the FCC promotes, by 5 years in order “to develop, standardize, and deploy equipment – either existing concepts in different spectrum or new concepts in existing spectrum.”  Out-of-band-emission (OOBE) levels are also likely to create interference in the remaining 30-megahertz of ITS spectrum raising questions about the reliability of the services; either C-V2X or DSRC.  OOBE limits are currently undefined in the current NPRM.

Similar concerns on the reassignment of the spectrum were also expressed by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure who has jurisdiction over commercial transportation. In a [letter](https://transportation.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2020-01-22 Full TI Letter to FCC.pdf) sent to the FCC Chairman and Commissioners, the committee expressed its alarm over the FCC’s proposal to reallocate the band to unlicensed operations noting its potential “to prevent many of the 37,000 traffic fatalities each year by impeding the development and deployment of safety-critical technologies.”  

Despite the concerns expressed by the other government authorities (DOT and the House Committee), FCC Chairman Pai appears unphased and has doubled down on he’s proposal to reallocate the band.
