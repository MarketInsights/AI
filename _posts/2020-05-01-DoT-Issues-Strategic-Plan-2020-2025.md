In March 2020, the Department of Transportation ("DoT") released its Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), Joint Program Office (JPO) [strategic plan](https://www.its.dot.gov/stratplan2020/ITSJPO_StrategicPlan_2020-2025.pdf) for 2020 through 2025.  The plan describes the vision, mission, strategies, and research goals that will guide the ITS JPO in meeting key priorities.  

The five broad strategies outlined in the plan include: (1) identifying and assessing emerging technologies; (2) coordinating and leading R&D programs; (3) evaluating and documenting demonstrations and developing models; (4) providing tools that educate the public and transport experts; and (5) working with standards development organizations to develop standards and guidance on interoperability for national and international ITS users.

Public comments are welcomed on the plan.
