On January 8, 2020, the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DoT”) and National Science & Technology Council (“NSTC”) released the fourth version of its Automated Vehicles series [“Ensuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies: Automated Vehicles 4.0 ("AV4.0")](https://www.transportation.gov/av/4).”

Building upon the previous three versions, AV4.0 outlines the USG’s policy approach to AV technologies.  In it, the USG details its authority to regulate, lists its research programs, and summarizes its investments strategy across the various USG agencies.  In an effort to ensure that it maintains the lead in AV research, development, and integration, the report also highlights USG’s efforts to be proactive by providing guidance, best practices, proposed research and pilot programs to help stakeholders in their investments.  And lastly, it details the USG’s 10 principles to foster research, development including safety, privacy, mobility, innovation, and standardizations.

Comments to AV4.0 are due in April 2020.
