The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) released a [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/adapt-safety-requirements-ads-vehicles-without-manual-controls) (NPRM) to update existing federal safety standards to accommodate and address automated vehicles.  The NPRM is one of many expected from the USDOT to modernize its rules for automated vehicles.

The proposed changes intend to update/revise requirements, test procedures, and certification criteria to address vehicles without manual controls for human operations.  The changes do not alter the requirements for occupant protection (or crashworthiness) for vehicles with traditional controls.  As an example provided in the USDOT press release, “…the NPRM proposes applying frontal passenger protection requirements to the traditional driver seating position when a steering wheel is not present, and clarifies the applicability of some occupant protection standards to vehicles with no occupant compartment, such as occupant-less delivery vehicles.”
